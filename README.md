## Thought for Enhanced Advanced DeepFake Detection & Secure Browsing Platform ##
# Overview 
This is a comprehensive AI-powered platform for detecting deepfakes in media files (images and videos) and providing secure browsing capabilities. It combines advanced neural network models (CNN-LSTM hybrid with pre-trained EfficientNet backbone), multi-modal analysis (video, audio, metadata), and a professional GUI built with Tkinter. The platform includes real-time stream monitoring, analytics dashboard, database integration for history tracking, and user authentication for secure access.

The system is designed for media authenticity verification, with features like face manipulation detection using 8 analysis metrics, performance optimization, and privacy protection through data anonymization.
Features

# Advanced DeepFake Detection:

CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture with pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 for feature extraction.
Multi-head self-attention and bidirectional LSTM for temporal analysis.
Supports image and video analysis.


# Enhanced Face Analysis:

8 detection methods: Compression artifacts, blending artifacts, lighting consistency, texture naturalness, geometric consistency, color naturalness, edge consistency, and frequency domain analysis.


# Real-Time Monitoring:

Supports webcam or RTSP streams for live deepfake detection.
Alerts and recording for suspicious content.


# Secure Browsing:

Uses Selenium for isolated browsing sessions.
Analyzes web content for potential deepfakes or risks.


# Analytics Dashboard:

Interactive visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Detection trends, statistics, and reports.


# Database Integration:

SQLite for storing analysis history, user sessions, and known samples.


# User Authentication:

Secure login with password hashing, TOTP support, and session management.
Lockout mechanisms for failed attempts.


# Performance Optimization:

Hardware detection (CPU/GPU) with psutil.
Logging and error handling.


# GUI Interface:

Tabbed interface for detection, browsing, monitoring, analytics, and settings.



Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.12.3)
Git (for cloning the repository)

# Steps

Clone the repository:
textgit clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection-platform.git
cd deepfake-detection-platform

Run the script to check and install dependencies automatically:
textpython main5.py

It will prompt to install missing packages (e.g., opencv-python, torch, selenium, etc.).
If automatic installation fails, install manually:
textpip install opencv-python torch torchvision torchaudio numpy pillow matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn cryptography requests psutil selenium webdriver-manager tkinter pyotp



Ensure ChromeDriver is installed (handled by webdriver-manager, but verify compatibility).
Run the application:
textpython main5.py


Note: GPU acceleration requires CUDA-enabled PyTorch (install via pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 or appropriate version).
Usage

Launch the GUI:

Run python main5.py.
Log in with credentials (default admin setup may be needed; see code for initial user creation).


Media Detection Tab:

Browse for an image/video file.
Click "Analyze Media" to get deepfake probability and details.


Secure Browsing Tab:

Enter a URL and click "Open in Secure Browser" for isolated analysis.


Stream Monitoring Tab:

Enter webcam index (e.g., 0) or RTSP URL.
Start/Stop monitoring for real-time detection.


Analytics Dashboard Tab:

Generate reports and view charts on past analyses.


Settings Tab:

Change password, cleanup old data, or logout.
